Assignment Description:
	1) Schema Creation and Data Loading into the tables, Majestic, Majestic_index1, Majestic_index2, Majestic_index3
	2) Query the tables for top domains
	3) Calculate the execution time for the queries and write an explanation
	4) Curl test the queries
	5) Apache JMeter testing


Time taken to load data into tables:

Majestic

real 19.107s
user 3.756s
sys 0.286s


Majestic_index1

real 31.918s
user 3.760s
sys 0.282s


Majestic_index2

real 27.443s
user 3.745s
sys 0.276s

Majestic_index3

real 33.635s
user 3.778s
sys 0.256s

The execution time for an insert statement in a table with no index is the fastest while that for a table with two index is the slowest. Hence insertion into MAJESTIC table (no index) takes least time where as insertion into MAJESTIC_INDEX3 (with two indexes) has the most time.

Time taken to execute query 1 in table:
MAJESTIC        :00:00:02.20
MAJESTIC_INDEX1 :00:00:01.77
MAJESTIC_INDEX2 :00:00:01.58
MAJESTIC_INDEX3 :00:00:05.32

Time taken to execute query 2 in table:
MAJESTIC        :00:00:00.12
MAJESTIC_INDEX1 :00:00:00.10
MAJESTIC_INDEX2 :00:00:00.11
MAJESTIC_INDEX3 :00:00:00.79

Time taken to execute query 3 in table:
MAJESTIC        :00:00:00.08
MAJESTIC_INDEX1 :00:00:00.06
MAJESTIC_INDEX2 :00:00:00.06
MAJESTIC_INDEX3 :00:00:00.27

In MAJESTIC_INDEX1, TLD column is indexed, in MAJESTIC_INDEX2 RefSubNets column is indexed, in MAJESTIC_INDEX3 TLD and RefIPs columns are indexed.
Single column indexing increases the query retrieval performance than other. 

PART 2 files included:
majestic.js 
majestic.html - all entry forms for both queries in the same html file (8 forms in total)
error.html
result.html


Execution of CURL:

There are 8 queries total: (2 queries x 4 tables)
